# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Optimize sorting operation in logistics with Deep Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Installations

This project uses Python and the following packages are used. 

- numpy
- math
- random
- collections
- tensorflow==1.14
- copy

### 2. Project Motivation
This is Capstone project is from my Data Scientist nanodegree with Udacity.
In this project, it was decided to optimize the arrangement(sorting) problem of logistics. For detail explanation check out my blog


The project involves:
- Generate data by simulating sorting operation
- Setup Reinforcement learning algorithm(Q-learning)
- Find simple suitable neural network for calculating Q-values


### 3. File Descriptions
#### DQN.py
This is the main file for my project. It contains class or functions for neural network and Q-learning. 

#### environment.py
Simulation will be done in this file. This file will generate data such as state, action and reward


### 4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

Data for coding project was provided by Udacity.
